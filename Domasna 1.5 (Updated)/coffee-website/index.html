                <h3>More than a beverages</h3>
                <p>Coffee is one of the most popular beverages globally, with an estimated 2.25 billion cups consumed
                    daily. Its history dates back centuries, and its cultural significance spans continents. From
                    Ethiopia, where the first coffee beans were discovered, to the modern-day coffeehouses that dot the
                    streets of cities worldwide, coffee has become more than just a drink. In this article, we'll dive
                    deep into the fascinating history and cultural significance of coffee.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    "What goes best with a cup of coffee? Another cup."
                    <cite>- Henry Rollins</cite>
                </blockquote>
                <p>The global spread of coffee had a significant impact on the world's economy. Coffee became a major
                    commodity, and the demand for it led to the development of transportation and communication
                    networks. The coffee trade also played a role in the colonization of many countries.</p>
                <p>Today, coffee is more popular than ever. It is the second most traded commodity in the world, after
                    oil, and it is consumed in virtually every country on the planet. Coffee has become an important
                    part of many cultures, and it is deeply ingrained in the daily routines of people all over the
                    world.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    "Without my morning coffee, I’m just like a dried-up piece of roast goat."
                    <cite>- Johann Sebastian Bach</cite>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Coffee's cultural significance is evident in the many ways it is consumed and enjoyed around the
                    world. In Italy, for example, coffee is consumed as a small, strong shot of espresso, while in the
                    United States, it is often enjoyed with milk and sugar. In some countries, such as Ethiopia and
                    Turkey, coffee is served with elaborate ceremonies that involve roasting and grinding the beans, and
                    serving the coffee in ornate cups.</p>
                <p>Coffee has also become a symbol of social and economic status. In some countries, coffee is seen as a
                    luxury item, and it is consumed only by the wealthy. In other countries, coffee is a staple of
                    everyday life, and it is consumed by people of all socioeconomic backgrounds.</p>
                <p>Coffee has also inspired several cultural traditions and rituals. In some countries, such as Sweden
                    and Finland, coffee breaks are a common workplace tradition, where coworkers gather to enjoy a cup
                    of coffee and socialize. In the Middle East, coffee is often served to guests as a sign of
                    hospitality.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    "I like my coffee like I like myself: strong, sweet, and too hot for you."
                    <cite>- Jac Vanek</cite>
                </blockquote>
                <p>The history and cultural significance of coffee are fascinating and multifaceted. From its discovery
                    in Ethiopia to its global impact on culture, coffee has played an important role in shaping our
                    world. Its popularity and importance are evident in the millions of people who grow, prepare, and
                    consume it every day. As we look to the future, it's clear that coffee will continue to be an
                    important part of our lives, both as a beverage and as a cultural touchstone. While the coffee
                    industry faces challenges, there is hope that it can become more sustainable and ethical, ensuring
                    that coffee continues to be enjoyed for generations to come.</p><br>

                <dl>
                    <dt>Coffee is a fruit</dt>
                    <dd>Despite it being called a ‘bean’, coffee is actually a fruit. The ‘beans’ grow on a bush and are
                        found in the centre of a berry, known as a coffee cherry.</dd>
                    <dt>Beethoven loved coffee</dt>
                    <dd>This may surprise you, but infamous composer, Beethoven, loved coffee! He was apparently quite
                        obsessive about it, using precisely 60 beans per cup and would spend time counting out each and
                        every bean.</dd><br>
                    <dt>Brazil grows the most coffee in the world</dt>
                    <dd>It’s widely known that Brazil is one of the biggest coffee hotspots, but did you know it’s
                        responsible for around a third of all the coffee in the world? Brazil is the number one coffee
                        producer, followed by Vietnam and Colombia.</dd><br>
                    <dt>Finland consumes the most coffee in the world</dt>
                    <dd>Where Brazil may grow the most, Finland drinks the most coffee! On average they drink 12kg per
                        person, per year which works out to an impressive 1,680 cups on average each a year. Now how’s
                        that for a coffee fact?</dd><br>
                    <dt>Coffee helped Brazil go to the Olympics</dt>
                    <dd>In 1932, the Brazilian government didn’t have enough money to send their athletes to the
                        Olympics, so they funded the trip by selling coffee. They loaded up a ship of coffee beans,
                        hoping to sell it to California on their way. We love this heart-warming coffee fact!</dd><br>
                    <dt>Coffee wasn’t always for drinking</dt>
                    <dd>Before coffee was discovered to be a delicious beverage, it was actually a food. East African
                        tribes would grind the berries and mix them with animal fat to eat.</dd><br>
                    <dt>Decaf doesn’t mean no caffeine</dt>
                    <dd>For a coffee to be classed as decaf, it needs to have less than 0.3% caffeine.</dd><br>
                    <dt>The decaffeination process helps to create our favourite fizzy drinks</dt>
                    <dd>Once caffeine has been removed (for decaf coffee), the caffeine will usually be sold to fizzy
                        drink or pharmaceutical companies.</dd><br>
                    <dt>Coffee was once banned</dt>
                    <dd>Coffee wasn’t always as loved as it is today. In the 18th century, governments tried to ban the
                        beverage because it was thought to stimulate radical thinking. Our favourite drink was actually
                        banned in Sweden for a while in 1746, along with anything related to it – including cups and
                        saucers!</dd><br>
                    <dt>The most expensive coffee in the world costs 600 dollars per pound</dt>
                    <dd>Kopi Luwak is the most expensive coffee in the world, and as of 2019, it cost $600 per pound.
                        Native to Indonesia, the coffee is roasted after being eaten, digested and expelled by the Palm
                        Civet. It’s said that they only eat the very best, sweetest and freshest coffee cherries and
                        when ingested, it’s naturally fermented, giving it a distinctive flavour. Would you try a cup of
                        Kopi Luwak?</dd>
