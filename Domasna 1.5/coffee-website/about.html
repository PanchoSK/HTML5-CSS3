                <p>Coffee drinks are made by brewing water with ground coffee beans. The brewing is either done slowly,
                    by drip, filter, French press, moka pot or percolator, or done very quickly, under pressure, by an
                    espresso machine. When put under the pressure of an espresso machine, the coffee is termed espresso,
                    while slow-brewed coffees are generally termed brewed coffee. While all coffee drinks are based on
                    either coffee or espresso, some drinks add milk or cream, some are made with steamed milk or
                    non-dairy milks, or add water (like the americano). Upon milk additions, coffee's flavor can vary
                    with different syrups or sweeteners, alcoholic liqueurs, and even combinations of coffee with
                    espresso or tea.There are many variations to the basic coffee or espresso bases.</p>

                <h2 id="historyofcoffee">History Of Coffee</h2>
                <h3>The legend of coffee origin begins in Ethiopia</h3>
                <p>Ethiopia is widely considered to be the epicentre of where coffee came from. If you’ve ever googled
                    “coffee history”, you will have come across the famous story of how coffee was discovered in
                    Ethiopia by Kaldi, an Ethiopian goat herder, around 800 AD.</p>
                <p>He wandered over to his goats to see them acting very strangely. They were energised and excited
                    after eating some berries from a tree. So, he tried the berries himself, and after he too felt
                    excitable and alert, Kaldi took these berries to a monk. The monks exclaimed that it was the work of
                    the devil and threw the berries into the fire. In doing so, a beautiful, heavenly aroma was released
                    and the berries were quickly raked from the fire and crushed into embers. Realising their mistake,
                    the monks then placed the berries into a jug and covered them with hot water for preservation. The
                    monks went on to drink this lovely new concoction, only to realise it helped them stay awake during
                    nightly devotions and prayers. Of course, this is probably just a wonderful legend and the history
                    of coffee is more likely to lie with the nomadic Oromo/Galla people of Ethiopia and northern Kenya.
                </p>
                <h3>Or does coffee history begin in Yemen?</h3>
                <p>There are also a few well-known stories about Yemen’s contribution in the discovery of coffee. The
                    most famous legend from Yemen about coffee origins has a slight twist on the Ethiopian story. A
                    Yemenite Sufi mystic was traveling through Ethiopia on spiritual matters. He encountered some very
                    energetic and enthusiastic birds that had been eating fruit off a plant, which is now known as the
                    coffee plant. Exhausted from his journey, he decided to try these berries for himself and he found
                    that they produced an energetic state in him as well. However, it’s largely believed that coffee
                    beans were originally exported from Ethiopia to Yemen. Yemeni traders later brought coffee plants
                    back to their homeland and began to grow them there.</p>
                <h3>The word quickly spread</h3>
                <p>As it’s thought that coffee originated in Ethiopia, it’s also believed it made its way north across
                    the red sea into Yemen in the 15th Century. It then started to be grown in the Yemeni district of
                    Arabia, and by the 16th century it was known in Persia, Egypt, Syria, and Turkey. It was immensely
                    popular for its qualities to help improve alertness and wakefulness, allowing people to devote more
                    time to spiritual matters and praying.</p>
                <h3>The world’s first coffee house</h3>
                <p>The world’s first coffee house was opened in Constantinople in 1475, now known as Istanbul. Coffee
                    was drunk at home as part of the daily routine, as well as to show hospitality to guests. Outside of
                    the home, people visited coffee houses to not only drink coffee but to engage in conversation,
                    listen to music, watch performers, play chess, gossip and catch up on news. Without the modern
                    technologies we have today, coffee houses quickly became the epicentre for exchanging and gathering
                    information. They were often referred to as “Schools of the Wise”. And with thousands of pilgrims
                    visiting Mecca each year from all over the world, knowledge of this “wine of Araby”, as it quickly
                    became known, began to spread.</p>
                <h3>Over to Europe</h3>
                <p>Then the course of coffee history begins to change. This exotic beverage certainly caused a stir for
                    European travellers who were filled with intrigue and fascination. So, by the 17th century, coffee
                    had made its way to Europe and became increasingly popular across the continent.European coffee
                    history begins in Italy, where it was imported from the Ottoman Empire. In particular, Venetian
                    merchants contributed to the widespread popularity of coffee in European regions and in 1645, the
                    first ever European coffee house was opened in Venice. Drinking coffee became a great commodity,
                    especially for wealthy people.</p>
                <p>Through the Dutch East India Company and British East India Company, coffee also became very popular
                    in England. The first coffee house in England opened in Oxford in 1651 and many others quickly
                    followed, particularly in London. Coffee houses were strictly for men only, where they could discuss
                    business and news, as well as socialise. It is said that many business ventures and ideas started in
                    London coffee houses.</p>
                <h3>The growth of coffee popularity in Asia</h3>
                <p>By the 1600’s, most coffee beans came from Yemen. Coffee beans were under strict surveillance and
                    those in power did everything they could to ensure fertile beans could not be grown elsewhere.
                    However, Baba Budan, a Muslim pilgrim, was about to change the path of coffee history forever. He
                    left Mecca to return to India in 1600, smuggling a handful of coffee beans. With the help of British
                    colonisers, these would become the seeds of the world’s first commercial coffee industry outside of
                    Africa and Arabia, which still produces coffee today.</p>
                <p>Coffee was first introduced to Indonesia in the late 1600’s by Dutch traders, and over the next
                    century it would make its way to dozens of Indonesia’s many islands, such as Sulawesi, Sumatra,
                    Java, and Bali. For a short period, several Indonesian islands were among the top coffee producers
                    in the world.</p>
                <p>Around the 1800s, coffee was cultivated in Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos by French colonisers.
                    The Dutch were finally allowed to grow coffee in the latter half of the 17th century and were
                    successful with their efforts on the island of Java, in what is now known as Indonesia. The plants
                    thrived and the Dutch began to play a significant role in trading coffee.</p>
                <h3>Crossing the Atlantic – coffee origins in the New World</h3>
                <p>The founder of the Colony of Virginia, Captain John Smith, introduced coffee to other settlers of
                    Jamestown in 1607. However, it wasn't well received at first and tea was much more preferred. In
                    1670, Dorothy Jones became the first person to receive a license to sell coffee in Boston. By the
                    mid-1700's, many taverns were also dubbed as coffeehouses, but tea was still the drink of choice. It
                    was only when a rebellion against Great Britain caused all the tea to be thrown into the sea and it
                    was considered unpatriotic to drink it any longer, that coffee became increasingly popular.</p>
                <p>The New World's hot, tropical weather was seen as a new ideal for the cultivation of coffee, and
                    coffee plantations quickly spread throughout Central America, with their first coffee harvest
                    occurring in 1726. Latin American countries also have ideal coffee-growing conditions, with a good
                    balance of sunshine and rain, high and humid temperatures, and rich soil. By the mid-18th century,
                    Latin American countries emerged as some of the top coffee producers, clearing extensive tropical
                    forests in preparation for plantations. Today, Brazil is the largest coffee producer in the world.

                <h2 id="coffeebeans">Coffee Beans</h2>
                <p>There are four different types of coffee beans, those being Robusta, Arabica, Liberica, and Excelsa.
                    However, the Arabica coffee bean is the most common, making up about 60% - 70% of the coffee that is
                    produced globally. Robusta is also a more common coffee bean used in coffee. Liberica and Excelsa
                    are the least common coffee beans, but you may sometimes come across them. Coffee beans are small
                    seeds that are found inside the coffee cherry of the coffee plant. The coffee cherry is not
                    consumed, instead, we pit the fruit and roast it. That is how we create the coffee we all know at
                    love, and this is where our favourite coffee beans come from.</p>

                <h2 id="brewingmethods">Brewing Methods</h2>
                <p>Appreciating the art of brewing coffee is a joy for any coffee lover. There are numerous ways to brew
                    coffee. Each brewing technique brings out unique flavors and aromas, shaping the experience of
                    sipping the world's favorite beverage. Let's dive into some of the most popular methods and
                    understand how to brew coffee using each one.</p>
                <h3>Types Of Brewing Methods:</h3>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>Drip Coffee</li>
                    <p>The Drip Coffee method is well-loved for its convenience and simplicity, producing a clean cup
                        with a pleasant aroma. It works by filtering hot water through coffee grounds.</p>
                    <li>French Press Coffee</li>
                    <p>The French press method hails from France and is known for its rich, full-bodied results. This
                        manual brewing method involves steeping coarsely ground beans in hot water before pressing the
                        liquid away from the grounds.</p>
                    <li>Espresso Machine Coffee</li>
                    <p>The true heart of Italian coffee culture, the Espresso Machine, produces small servings of strong
                        and concentrated coffee known as "shots." This method forces hot water under high pressure
                        through finely ground coffee.</p>
                    <li>Pour Over Coffee</li>
                    <p>Pour over coffee is a widely acclaimed brewing method by coffee aficionados worldwide. It allows
                        control over variables like brewing time and water temperature, leading to a complex and highly
                        rewarding cup of coffee.</p>
                    <li>Cold Brew Coffee</li>
                    <p>Cold Brew is a refreshing coffee brewing method known for its low acidity and naturally sweet
                        taste. The brewing process can last up to 24 hours, as cold water gently extracts flavors over
                        an extended period.</p>
                    <li>Percolate Coffee</li>
                    <p>Percolate coffee is traditional and has a nostalgic charm attached to it. This brewing method
                        involves repeatedly cycling the boiling water flow through the coffee grounds using gravity
                        until the desired strength is reached.</p>
                    <li>Vacuum Coffee</li>
                    <p>Originally from Japan, the vacuum coffee (Siphon) brewing method creates coffee using two
                        chambers where vapor pressure and vacuum work together. This method is known for the clean,
                        crisp flavors it produces.</p>

            <article>
                <h2 id="healthbenefits">Health Benefits</h2>
                <p>Coffee is rich in plant defence chemicals called polyphenols these have a protective, antioxidant
                    effect. Organic fresh (beans or ground) coffee is best as it has a higher antioxidant content, with
                    light or medium roast blends preferable to dark. How long the beans have been stored will also
                    influence their polyphenol levels, with a reduction seen in coffee beans stored for 12 months or
                    longer.</p>
                <h3>Top 10 health benefits of coffee:</h3>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>Rich In Antioxidant</li>
                    <p>One of the greatest benefits of coffee is that it's rich in antioxidants, especially in green
                        coffee beans. Every cup of coffee carries these antioxidants, and is especially high in
                        polyphenols, which work together with other minerals to help your body and cells function
                        optimally, preventing disease, and maintaining good health in general.</p>
                    <li>Activates The Mind</li>
                    <p>Coffee is rich in caffeine, which is the is the component of coffee that stimulates and activates
                        our bodies and minds. It helps to improve some cognitive functions, and your memory. Caffeine
                        also helps us to stay focused, energised, and alert - just another benefit of drinking coffee,
                        black or with milk.</p>
                    <li>Helps Protect Against Heahaches</li>
                    <p>Caffeine is a natural vasodilator, which means it helps to decrease blood pressure by preventing
                        the muscles in your veins from tightening up and getting narrower. People who suffer from
                        headaches could benefit from coffee, especially if they add some milk. It’s important to not
                        overdo it – even 3 cups of coffee a day could be too much, and it could easily become a trigger
                        for headaches and migraines.</p>
                    <li>It Keeps Athletes Refreshed,Energised and Alert</li>
                    <p>People who are very active - whether it's just regular exercise for fitness reasons, or even a
                        professional athlete - will also benefit from drinking coffee, due to the caffeine content in
                        every cup. It helps to improve physical performance by helping the body to lower the effects of
                        fatigue, improving focus, and staying alert and focused.</p>
                    <li>Contributes To Weight Loss</li>
                    <p>Caffeine has long been used to assist with weight loss, often used in various compounds, creams,
                        or other products. This is because caffeine speeds up a process in the body called
                        "thermogenesis", which is how the body naturally burns fat. Interestingly enough, black coffee
                        benefits the body more than milky coffee in these instances, which might be due to the fat
                        content in the milk being used, or added sugar, which is a known contributor to weight gain.
                        However, coffee shouldn't be used alone in an attempt to lose weight - it's best to combine your
                        daily coffee with regular exercise, a healthy, nutritional diet, and plenty of water intake. In
                        fact, coffee can actually cause your body to retain water, which is one of the contributing
                        factors to weight gain. A moderate amount every day will help you get the best benefits coffee
                        has to offer.</p>
                    <li>Protect Against Cancer,Stroke And Coronary Diseases</li>
                    <p>A large study done in 2018 by the National Cancer Institute of the United State showed a
                        correlation between a higher consumption coffee, and a lower mortality rate from cancer,
                        strokes, and heart diseases. While the results cannot be seen as definitive, it’s interesting to
                        see the possibilities of what other benefits coffee could have on the overall health of the
                        human body.</p>
                    <li>Combat Alzheimer's and Parkinson's</li>
                    <p>The relationship between drinking coffee, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and
                        Parkinson's, has been studied for years. It's very possible that regularly consuming coffee
                        could reduce the likelihood of these diseases in the future.</p>
                    <li>Reduces The Risk Of Type 2 Diabetes</li>
                    <p>Yet another interesting potential health benefit of coffee is a 25% lower chance of suffering
                        from Type 2 Diabetes, by drinking a maximum of 3 or 4 cups a day. It’s not entirely clear how it
                        lowers the chances of the disease, but coffee is rich in antioxidants, has anti-inflammatory
                        properties, and has an impact on the process in the body that burns fat.</p>
                    <li>It's Good For The Heart</li>
                    <p>We already know that one of the benefits of coffee it that it offers protects against coronary
                        heart disease. In the past, coffee - and it's high caffeine content - has been linked to an
                        increased risk of heart disease.</p>
